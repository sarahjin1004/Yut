# The Game of Yut (윷놀이)
Traditional Korean Game to play with families and friends!
## How it works
The rules can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yut).  <br />

- The pieces can be dragged around, and the pieces can actually be updated with images of your choice. 
- By pressing "Roll!" button, you can see that it displays the player and the roll number.
- Instead of Yut sticks, I have decided to implement with dice, with probabilities of rolling a certain number also accounted for.
